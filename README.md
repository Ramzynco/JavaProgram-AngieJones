# My Journey through Java

We have so many resources at our disposal, and I can attest that it can be rather daunting. I'm now participating in SALT's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.\
\
I've already completed the initial week of what SALT refer to as the "hell weeks," and I still have one more to go. To be very honest, despite actively participating in the MOB this week, I struggled with the fundamentals.\
\
I won't write endless lines on this, but I'm journaling in the hope that sharing my experience will be helpful to anyone who wants to become a Java Full Stack Developer.ðŸŒŸ

I will guide you through a training session using the materials that, after extensive research over many hours, weeks, and months, turned out to be remarkably successful. In essence, I'm trying to save you from having to go through that since it's so difficult and perplexing. Please feel free to return to my journal and I guarantee to walk you through a thorough guide if you still feel lost after completing several courses and searches. You can also get in touch with me, and I would love to provide you with additional support.&#x20;

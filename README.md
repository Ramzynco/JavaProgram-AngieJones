# My Journey

We have a plethora of resources at our disposal, and I can attest that it can be rather overwhelming. I'm currently studying in SALT's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

I've just survived the first of what SALT refer to as the "hell weeks," and I still have yet another to go. To be absolutely honest, despite partaking in the MOB in the last week, I battled with the fundamentals.

#### I won't be writing interminable lines on this, but I decided to journal in hope that sharing my journey will be beneficial to anyone who wants to become a Java Full Stack Developer.

I'll lead you through a manual using the sources that I discovered to be incredibly helpful after spending numerous hours, days, and even weeks completing research. I'm trying to prevent you from going through it primarily because it's so frustrating and confusing. After completing several courses and searches, if you still feel overwhelmed and uncertain as to where you stand, adopt this journal as a resource.

#### To be honest, we didn't really run first, did we? Children are sometimes taught new concepts in a more understandable manner. So let's start with crawling. These videos are extremely informative and make a lot of sense when introduced to new topics.

### Programmers Write Source Code <a href="#heading-programmers-write-source-code" id="heading-programmers-write-source-code"></a>

Programming is designing and implementing software. The functionality is implemented based on the wishes and requirements of the users and the customers. Programs are typically implemented (i.e., written or "coded") in a programming language meant to be written and read by humans.

There are hundreds of programming languages out there, and this course focuses one of them. The language used in this course is [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_\(programming\_language\)), which is one of the most commonly-used programming languages in the world. \


> Learning Java also makes it easier to pick up other programming languages.

Programming languages, such as Java, have many commands built-in that a programmer uses when developing software. This makes programming easier as you don't need to implement everything from scratch. For example, programming languages typically have built-in options available for different menus and views used for making graphical user interfaces. Indeed, a large part of programming is making use of available functions and tools in solving problems â€” this, however, requires programming experience, which you only gain by programming.\

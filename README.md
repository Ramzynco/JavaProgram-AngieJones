# My Journey through Java

We have a plethora of resources at our disposal, and I can attest that it can be rather overwhelming. I'm currently studying in SALT's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

I've just survived the first of what SALT refer to as the "hell weeks," and I still have yet another to go. To be absolutely honest, despite partaking in the MOB in the last week, I battled with the fundamentals.

#### I won't be writing interminable lines on this, but I decided to journal in hope that sharing my journey will be beneficial to anyone who wants to become a Java Full Stack Developer.

I'll lead you through a manual using the sources that I discovered to be incredibly helpful after spending numerous hours, days, and even weeks completing research. I'm trying to prevent you from going through it primarily because it's so frustrating and confusing. After completing several courses and searches, if you still feel overwhelmed and uncertain as to where you stand, adopt this journal as a resource.

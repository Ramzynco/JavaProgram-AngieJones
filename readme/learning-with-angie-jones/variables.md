{% code title="Creating a variable" overflow="wrap" %}
```java
int speedLimit = 80;
```
{% endcode %}

Here, speedLimit is a variable of int data type and we have assigned value **80** to it.The int data type suggests that the variable can only hold integers.

In the example, we have assigned value to the variable during declaration. However, it's not mandatory. You can declare variables and assign variables separately.&#x20;

For example,

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```java
int speedLimit;
speedLimit = 80;
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Java is a statically-typed language. It means that all variables must be declared before they can be used.
{% endhint %}

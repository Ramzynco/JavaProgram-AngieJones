# If

You can select in which way a program develops depending on the value of some variable or an input. This is called branching or applying conditions.

In Java, branching is done through the keyword _if_. After an _if_ there must be a parentheses enclosing a condition that simplifies into a single boolean value.

When the code reaches a conditional statement, **if** the condition is equivalent to _true_, the block of code enclosed by braces after it will be executed.

The code displayed here exemplifies this concept. Run it and examine how it operates.\

**LET'S SIMPLIFY THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE**\
You know how in a story sometimes things can change depending on what happens? Well, in computer programming, we can also make things change based on different things that happen.\

We use something called an "if statement" to do this. Think of it like a big "if this happens, then do this" sign. The computer checks if what's inside the parentheses is true or false, kind of like a yes or no question.

If the answer is "yes" or "true", then the computer does the things written inside the curly braces. If the answer is "no" or "false", then the computer skips over that part and moves on to the next thing.

Just remember, when you use an if statement, you can't put a semicolon at the end. That's how the computer knows it's a special kind of command.

```
if (condition) {
   // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

Here, `condition` is an expression that can be either `true` or `false`. If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces `{}` will be executed.



You can also add an `else` clause to run code if the condition is false:

```
// Some code
```

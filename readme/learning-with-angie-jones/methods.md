# Methods

Suppose you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two methods to solve this problem:

* a method to draw the circle
* a method to color the circle

Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.

In Java, there are two types of methods:

* **User-defined Methods**: We can create our own method based on our requirements.
* **Standard Library Methods**: These are built-in methods in Java that are available to use.



{% hint style="info" %}
Try this [challenge](https://www.scaler.com/topics/challenge/259658/methods-in-java/) and test your knowledge on methods.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% code title="The Syntax to declare a method" overflow="wrap" %}
```java
returnType methodName() {
  // method body
}
```
{% endcode %}

Here,

* **returnType** - It specifies what type of value a method returns For example if a method has an `int` return type then it returns an integer value.\
  \
  If the method does not return a value, its return type is `void`.
* **methodName** - It is an [identifier](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/keywords-identifiers#identifiers) that is used to refer to the particular method in a program.
* **method body** - It includes the programming statements that are used to perform some tasks. The method body is enclosed inside the curly braces `{ }`.
